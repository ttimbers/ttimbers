Here\u0026rsquo;s draft one\u0026hellip; Comments/feedback welcome.\nAs a result of my experiences, I have come to believe the most important things that an educator can do to facilitate learning in their students is to provide motivation for what is being learned, provide scaffolding and guidance for the building of a respectful and supportive community for learners, as well as embody responsiveness in their teaching and classroom management. In prioritizing these three aspects of my teaching I hope that I inspire curiosity in the subjects I teach, create a safe and collaborative learning space, as well as reduce friction and barriers to learning.\nI believe that motivation is important for successful learning, as it can energize, direct, and sustain learning. One way I motivate students in the classroom is by presenting real-world, problems that they will be able to tackle when they master the content and skills we are embarking upon learning. The problems I choose are modern, and relevant to the real world, which I often draw from the Master of Data Science Capstone projects. I also choose accessible problems, however, that do not require too much domain expertise so that it distracts from the data science aims or goals of solving the problem.\nAnother motivational tactic that I use are live demos of the data products they will build to solve the problems we are learning to solve - I show them the finished product (e.g., a beautiful data visualization, a data analysis pipeline, an R/Python package), illustrate how it is used, and then pass the product to the students and let them use it. I choose demos that are beautiful, or that clearly would take a long time to run, or that would be very brittle, if not programmatically automated. I also provide story-like narration with the demos, describing the need for the data product, the intended audience for the product and why creating the product in such a way as we did (usually using reproducible and transparent methods) has advantages over creating it in other ways. Once this motivation is in place, students are curious how to learn to solve the problems I present, or create the products I demonstrate, and their brains are primed for learning.\nFrom my experience, building of a respectful and supportive community for learners is fundamental for leveling the playing field across a group of heterogeneous learners - which is essentially any group of learners. In a classroom where a respectful and supportive community is not built, only some learners who have certain privileges are likely to succeed. In such an unsafe environment, many learners lacking these certain privileges will become demotivated, frustrated, and feel alone. Their learning will suffer because of this, no matter how well the content is delivered by the teacher. Thus, for each group of learners I teach, I strive to provide scaffolding and guidance to enable the building of a respectful and supportive community for learners using several strategies.\nOne thing I do is to provide each group of learners a code of conduct that clearly outlines what behaviors are not acceptable in our learning spaces, and a process for reporting if a code of conduct violation is observed. Importantly, I provide contact details for a secondary reporting person, other than myself, in case I was the one to (unintentionally) violate the code of conduct. Another example of how I try to create a respectful and supportive community is through the use of group projects and assignments. I use randomly assigned groups to encourage learners to interact with others that they might not typically interact with (due to unconscious biases). To facilitate groups working well together, I have them draft a teamwork contract together in their first co-working session. Additionally, students are made aware they will receive a teamwork grade that is in part, informed by their teammates reports on how well they worked together. This social scaffolding around a typically challenging task (group work) helps facilitate the building of collegial and social relationships between learners, and strengthens the community beyond the work done in the group project.\nI also believe that responsiveness in teaching is critical to supporting learning. Each group of learners is different - even two sections of the same course being taught at the same time. Furthermore, the world around us is constantly changing. I am writing the teaching statement in the midst of the global pandemic of 2020 - which was the greatest societal shift I have ever lived through. The amount of required flexibility and responsiveness to policies and procedures, technological tools, student capacity, and teacher capacity from March 2020 - onward, when our university shifted to teaching online in less than a week\u0026rsquo;s time was incredible. Embracing responsiveness and flexibility as a teacher in this situation clearly helped support my students through this extremely challenging time. And in reflection, I see that responsiveness in teaching has always been critically important, however I am only now growing enough as an educator to see this and place the right amount of emphasis on it.\n","date":1598745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598824084,"objectID":"cfecef33a079f3985831bab05ee6a0b9","permalink":"https://tiffanytimbers.com/post/reboot-teaching-philosophy/","publishdate":"2020-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/reboot-teaching-philosophy/","section":"post","summary":"After teaching data science for several years, and through a global pandemic, I have decided to reboot my teaching philosophy.

Reproducible reports, a single document contains both the code needed to create figures and tables as well as the written narrative that tells the story of the analysis (e.g., Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown reports), are gaining buy-in traction in the Data Science community due to fact that they allow for re-creation an analysis from beginning to end, and because they help make an analysis tranparent or auditable. Reproducible presentation tools, however, are less well known. Many Data Scientists and researchers that value reprodcuibility are still using the more commonly known what you see is what you get (WYSWYG) presentation tools (e.g., Power Point, Keynote, Google Slides, etc), perhaps because until vert recently the reproducible presentation tools were less mature in terms of visual appeal and the ability to be used in collaboration with others who are not familar with things like Markdown or LaTeX syntax. This blog post aims to motivate those currently not using reproducible presentation tools to try one out, and guide them in their choice of tool based on their intended use case.\nBefore I dig into the tools, I will first try to answer why I recommend reproducible presentations? At first glance they seem like much more work… And yes, sometimes they are, for example if it is just a one off presentation that you will never re-use ever again. But if it is a presentation you might re-use, or your analysis might change (and hence your figures and tables in the presentation might change) then in the long run this actually saves you time. In my career, I too started out creating presentations using Power Point and Keynote. However, when I was working on a long project with large tables and many figures, with several presentations along the way at various stages in the analysis I realized how much time I was wasting copying and pasting figures and tables from my re-run analysis into Power Point/Keynote and I got very sad and thought there has to be a better way… Through the Software Carpentry community I learned about using reproducible presentation tools, which like reproducible reports automatically update tables and figures when you render the presentation. Once I switched to reproducible presentations for these sorts of projects I saved a lot of time overall (and made a lot less copy-paste mistakes). Additionally, these tools made my presentations auditable and transparent - it was clear where my tables and figures came from.\n Options for tools for reproducible presentations Below I list and comment on several reproducible presentation tools that I do (or would) use, as well as comment on which tool to choose based on the intended use case.\nJupyter Rise slides  If you are familiar with Jupyter notebooke, then I would suggest that these are the easiest to use, but there is a cost that they are the least flexible in terms of styling. I like that you get to render each slide/cell as you create the presentation using the run buttons in Jupyter. It’s also really easy and smooth to transition from the slide presentation view to the notebook view and back. I like them when I have presentations where I want to run and edit code on the fly. So great for teaching Data Science in the classroom, but I am less likely to use these at a conference or in a boardroom presentation.\nXaringan R Markdown slides  These are only slightly more challenging to use compared to Jupyter Rise slides, however, they have a lot more options in terms of styling, and the defaults are quite zen and easy on the eye. For creating and editing the slides, there is now a new feature that you can see live updates of the slides using the viewer using the xaringan::inf_mr() function (see demo here). This is currently my go to presentation platform at a conference or in a boardroom presentation.\nR Markdown to Power point slides)  This is a newer tool that I have not yet to try, but that looks very interesting that let’s you render from R Markdown to Powerpoint. This default styling of this tool may not be as beautiful/zen as Xaringan but has the added benefit(?) that as you slide deck gets circulated up in an organization your supervisors/bosses/C-level execs can edit it.\nMarkdown to Google slides  This tool let’s you render from R Markdown to Google Slides (whose default is more beautiful/zen than Power point). This means that again you get reproducible slides which give you a WYSWYG (what you see is what you get) platform to share upwards with less technically savvy folks. Would be nice to see this be an option out of R Markdown (so that code could be run and rendered within one doc), but that does not yet seem to be a tool that exists (open source project anyone????). So with this one, I would write an R/Python notebook/script to generate and save my figures and tables and the import them into the markdown doc using file paths.\n  ","date":1560124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560124800,"objectID":"680080528ab6d7d9f87aa4085d03ec77","permalink":"https://tiffanytimbers.com/post/2019-06-10-r-rmarkdown/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-06-10-r-rmarkdown/","section":"post","summary":"Reproducible presentations why and what tools?

How do you do this? Do you take the primer paint, and then paint one square foot, let it dry, then paint the first coat of that same square foot of wall, let it dry and then paint on the second coat of that same square foot and let it dry, then move onto the next square foot of wall and repeat the whole process? Would you ever actually use this strategy for painting? No - that would be insane, inefficient, and although the individual square feet of wall might look good, the places where they connect and overlap with the other square feet will look less than ideal.\nThis is the same when it comes to writing. It is tempting, or at least sometimes we can get caught in a bit of writers block, where we work to perfect each sentence one at a time, before we move onto the next. This process of writing is also very inefficient, and although the individual sentences might be perfect, the structure and flow of the document as a whole will be lacking.\nSo what is the “best” strategy for writing? It’s the same process as the “best” strategy for painting your bedroom. Start with the primer, paint the whole room with it. This is analogous to creating your outline for the document you are writing. Then move onto the first coat of paint, and again, paint the whole room. It doesn’t have to be perfect, because you will be applying a second and perhaps even a third coat of paint. This is analogous to writing your first draft based off your outline. To quote Nike, “just do it!” Don’t think to hard about spelling, grammar, what words to use. You can improve all of this later. Almost think of a free flow of consciousness under each bullet point in your outline. You write the entire document.\nThen you apply the second coat of paint to your room. This is analogous to your second draft of your document. You can now spend time improving the spelling, grammar, and what words to use. Again, you go through the entire document. After this, you should now have something with decent structure/flow and decent spelling and grammar. If you decide to spend more time, by applying a third or even fourth coat of paint to your document, you will refine it even more, and produce an even higher quality document.\nI have tried many strategies for writing throughout my academic training and career, and this is one that I have found to be the most effective and efficient. I must thank Dr. Ian Taylor (Botanist from UBC) from whom I learned of this analogy of writing a document being like painting a room. It has truly served me well, and I hope it does for you too.\n","date":1484006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484006400,"objectID":"e74a8cec580e0d7fd53c7351c6520020","permalink":"https://tiffanytimbers.com/post/2017-01-10-r-rmarkdown/","publishdate":"2017-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-01-10-r-rmarkdown/","section":"post","summary":"Food for thought as you approach your next writing project:\nImagine you are painting your bedroom.
